# KernelModuleManagement-Operator

## Purpose 

In this section we are going to show-case :

- How to build an out-of-tree kernel driver, for this example we have used `simple-kmod`.
- How to apply the out-of-tree kernel driver to your OCP cluster in the following stages:
    - as day2 operation;
    - as day1 operation.
